# Exercise 6: HTML - Skeleton for a Movie

**Note:** The result of this exercise must be shown to the teacher and approved before it can be considered completed. It will be presented together with Exercise 7.

## HTML

To build web-based applications, we must first learn to structure and design a simple website, as it is the websites that all upcoming applications will function and display on. However, today we will not write any functionality, but will only focus on the appearance of a website from scratch.

## HTML5

A website is built using HTML5, which is a markup language similar to XML. It is based on tags, and below is a list of those that will be needed today, along with a link to most other tags and how they are used:

- `<html>`     Declares that everything within the tag will be HTML (root element)
- `<head>`     Declares the beginning and end of the document head (information)
- `<title>`    The document's title, this tag is placed in `<head>`
- `<meta>`     Metadata, this tag is also placed in `<head>`
- `<link>`     Link to another document, usually `.js` (JavaScript) or `.css` (stylesheet)
- `<body>`     Declares the beginning and end of the document body, what is shown in the browser
- `<h1-6>`    Different headings
- `<header>`   The document's header
- `<footer>`   The document's footer
- `<a>`        A hyperlink
- `<img>`      An image
- `<iframe>`   Inline frame to embed another document, such as a YouTube video.

You can find a list of other remaining tags and descriptions at:
[W3Schools HTML Tags](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/)

## HTML5 Assignment

You have been tasked by Filmbolaget FS to create a promotional page for a currently screening movie. To do this, you first need to structure the page into different sections. These sections should be as follows:

- Header for the page
- Space for information on the page
- Space for video on the page
- A list of links relevant to the movie
- Footer on the page

Once you have created this structure in HTML, the following is desired:

- The header should contain a logo or an image representing the movie's title.
- The information section should contain a short snippet about when the film premieres, the director, actors, and a brief description of the film.
- The video section should display a trailer for the film via YouTube (please use YouTube's embed code under the “share” button -> “Embed”).
- Important links should be placed at the bottom of the page, just before the footer.
- The footer should list you as the webmaster and state that the assignment comes from FS.

**Note:** In this submission, you should only write HTML. CSS and other components will come in later exercises. It may not look very appealing, but that’s not the focus right now.

You do not need to use Visual Studio for this exercise, although it is possible. Any text editor will work fine. Sublime or Notepad++ are two convenient alternatives that provide highlighting and other tools.

Before submission: Run your HTML through the validator:
[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)

Good luck!
